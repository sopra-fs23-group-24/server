# "Who said that?" - A party quiz game  
"Who said that?" is a party game for 4 of more players, which functions as a fun ice breaker or socialising activity when talking to new people, acquaintances or even old friends.

## Introduction
Instead of just asking each other the same lame questions over and over again, we wanted to create a fun and easy way to socialise and learn a bit about people.
Our quiz game revolves around the participants themselves and tests their knowledge of each other.


- roughly explained:
  - All players answer a set of initial prompts
  - Each type of prompt requires a different answer: a drawing, some text or telling a true/false story.
  - Next, the players participate in a quiz-like game that asks: "Who said that?" - and everybody takes a guess.
  - The goal is to be as correct and as fast as possible.

## Technologies used

- JPA, hibernate database, REST, Google Cloud, GitHub, Gradle, Spring Boot


## High-level components

All our controller and services hold main functionalities for our application. (For each entity there is one service and one controller, and an additional service for generating the quiz questions.)
- the package with all our controllers: [controller](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fcontroller)
- the package with all our services: [service](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fservice)

These are the five most important classes:
- [GameController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fcontroller%2FGameController.java) is responsible for client/server communication as far as the game directly is concerned, that means creating games, sending game information and changing states. It is also responsible for hiding correct answers for quiz questions until all players provided a guess.
- [GameService.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fservice%2FGameService.java) is responsible for actually applying the functionalities mentioned above to the repositories and entities.
- [PromptAnswerService.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fservice%2Fprompt%2FPromptAnswerService.java) transforms prompt answers from users into entities that can be utilised to generate quiz questions.
- [QuizQuestionGenerator.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fservice%2Fquiz%2FQuizQuestionGenerator.java) combines information from a Game, its Prompts, the received PromptAnswers and our PotentialQuestions into functional and fair quiz questions.
- [QuizAnswerService.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fservice%2Fquiz%2FQuizAnswerService.java) calculates scores for players and is reponsible for controlling the flow of the quiz.



## Launch & Deployment

- #### Build  

  - ```bash
      ./gradlew build 
    ```
  - we build this project with gradle: (https://gradle.org/)

  
- #### Run

  - ```bash
      ./gradlew bootRun
      ```
  
  - The running server will be "stuck" at: "80% EXECUTING [time]" - this is normal. 
  - The last log in the terminal should 
    say: "Started Application", indicating that the application (the server) is running.
  - Additionally, this can be checked by visiting the `localhost:8080`, which will show the text: "The application is running."

- #### Test
  - ```bash
    ./gradlew test
    ```
  - And with the built-in test functionality of your IDE of choice.
  - We also recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to test your API Endpoints.

- #### Dependencies and databases 
  - The JPA / hibernate database does not need to be run separately, neither to any dependencies.  


- #### Development
  - To make development faster and easier, you can use the "development mode":
    - use `./gradlew build --continuous`, to re-build to the code with every change 
  - If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:
      - `./gradlew build --continuous -xtest`
  - While running one of the two commands above, run the server in another terminal:
    - `./gradlew bootRun`


- #### Deployment 
  - The project is set up to automatically deploy, each time you push onto the main branch. This is done via the GitHub workflow in [main.yml](.github%2Fworkflows%2Fmain.yml)

    
## Roadmap

- Adding new "game modes" respectively question types, like "rate this on a scale of 1-10", or other.
- Changing the calculation of points to include "answer-streaks". 
- Making the game even more customisable by letting the users choose how many questions the want to be generated, per prompt. 
- allowing players to create custom prompts within the existing types
- Adding progress indicators:
  - on how far the other players are with answering their prompts
  - in the quiz: 
    - on each question - how many players have already answered 
    - in general - showing how many questions out of the total amount have been answered
- Adding a "go back" option to allow "undo" and the re-writing of already answered prompts  

(This is the same as in the client README, because the two parts of our application are closely connected, in achieving these features.)
