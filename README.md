# "Who said that?" - party game  
We have created a party game, which makes getting to know people easier and more fun. 

## Introduction:
Instead of just asking each other the same lame questions over and over again, we wanted to create a fun
and easy way to getting to know people. To achieve this we created a quiz game, revolving around the participants
themselves.   

roughly explained:
- All players answer the questions that are posed initially.  
- Next the quiz asks: "Who said that?" - and everybody takes a guess. 
- The goal is to be as correct and as fast as possible.  

## Technologies used

- JPA, hibernate database, REST, Google Cloud, GitHub, Gradle, Spring Boot


## High-level components:
- Our main file, running the application: [Application.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2FApplication.java)    
  - but not really that important though, at least no to us in this course, since we left it as it was 


- Our main components are all of our services and controllers.   
(For each entity one of each, and an additional service for generating the quiz questions.)
  - the package with all our services: [service](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fservice)  
    - the service (or class) for generating quiz questions: 
    [QuizQuestionGenerator.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fservice%2Fquiz%2FQuizQuestionGenerator.java)
  - the package with all our controllers: [controller](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fch%2Fuzh%2Fifi%2Fhase%2Fsoprafs23%2Fcontroller)


## Launch & Deployment:
Write down the steps a new developer joining your team would
have to take to get started with your application. What commands are required to build and
run your project locally? How can they run the tests? Do you have external dependencies
or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?

- #### Build  

  - ```bash
      ./gradlew build 
    ```
  - we build this project with gradle: (https://gradle.org/)

  
- #### Run

  - ```bash
      ./gradlew bootRun
      ```
  
  - the running server will be "stuck" at: "80% EXECUTING [time]" - this is normal. 
  - The last log in the terminal should 
    say: "Started Application", indicating that the application (the server) is running.
  - Additionally, this can be checked by visiting the `localhost:8080`, which will show the text: "The application is running."

- #### Test
  - ```bash
    ./gradlew test
    ```
  - and with the built-in test functionality of your IDE of choice.
  - We recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to test your API Endpoints.

- #### Dependencies and databases 
  - The JPA / hibernate database does not need to be run separately, neither to any dependencies.  


- #### Development
  - to make development faster and easier, you can use the "development mode":
    - using `./gradlew build --continuous`, to re-build with each change to the code
  - If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:
      - `./gradlew build --continuous -xtest`
  - While running one of the two commands above, run the server in another terminal:
    - `./gradlew bootRun`


- #### Deployment 
  - On each push to the main branch, the project is automatically deployed to google cloud.  

    
## Roadmap:

- adding new "game modes" respectively question types, like "rate this on a scale of 1-10", or other.
- changing the calculation of points to include "answer-streaks". 
- making the game even more customisable by letting the users choose how many questions the want to be generated, per prompt. 
- adding progress indicators:
  - on how far the other players are with answering their prompts
  - in the quiz: 
    - on each question - how many players have already answered 
    - in general - showing how many questions out of the total amount have been answered
- adding a "go back" option to allow "undo" and the re-writing of already answered prompts
